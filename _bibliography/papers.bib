  title={Finding Common Ground: A Two-Opinion Approach to Reducing Polarization in Networks},
  abstract={The most obvious strategy for reducing polarization in social networks is to connect people with opposing views. However, this is neither realistic nor likely to result in productive connections or conversations. To reduce polarization in networks, we propose a two-dimensional model with two opinion sets, each representing a different issue. We introduce a new \textit{common ground} strategy to more realistically reduce polarization on a primary issue, by creating connections between individuals with similarities on a separate, secondary issue. We propose a new polarization metric and measure our common ground strategy's impact on polarization on both real-world networks. We find a significant reduction in polarization through utilization of this strategy.},

  abstract={Operational deployment of a fully automated greenhouse gas (GHG) plume detection system remains an elusive goal for imaging spectroscopy missions, despite recent advances in deep learning approaches. With the dramatic increase in data availability, however, automation continues to increase in importance for natural and anthropogenic emissions monitoring. This work reviews and addresses several key obstacles in the field: data and label quality control, prevention of spatiotemporal biases, and correctly aligned modeling objectives. We demonstrate through rigorous experiments using multicampaign data from airborne and spaceborne instruments that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to achieve operational detection performance when these obstacles are alleviated. We demonstrate that a multitask model that learns both instance detection and pixelwise segmentation simultaneously can successfully lead towards an operational pathway. We evaluate the model's plume detectability across emission source types and regions, identifying thresholds for operational deployment. Finally, we provide analysis-ready data, models, and source code for reproducibility, and work to define a set of best practices and validation standards to facilitate future contributions to the field.},

  title={Consensus Based Optimization Accelerates Gradient Descent}, 
  author={Anagha Satish and Ricardo Baptista and Franca Hoffmann},
  year={2024},
  abstract={We propose a novel algorithm for integrating gradient information into Consensus Based Optimization (CBO), a recently proposed multi-particle gradient-free optimization method. During each iteration, a subset of particles are updated using local gradient information, while others are updated using a traditional CBO step. We propose a method for subset selection and investigate its empirical performance. The algorithm combines gradient and gradient-free optimization to encourage exploring the state space while maintaining fast convergence. We investigate the tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost when adjusting the number of gradient evaluations. When applied to classification tasks in machine learning, the proposed algorithm attains a similar accuracy to ensemble gradient methods based on Gradient Descent or Adam at a reduced computational cost.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
