I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe/).

Previously, I studied at Caltech, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Information and Data Science. At Caltech, I was fortunate to work on projects with Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and Prof. [Franca Hoffmann](https://francahoffmann.com/). I also spent a wonderful summer at NASA JPL's [Machine Learning and Instrument Autonomy group](https://ml.jpl.nasa.gov/).
